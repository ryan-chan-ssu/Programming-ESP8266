 * Project/Program Name : Programming ESP8266
 * Author               : Ryan Chan
 * Date                 : 15/10/2024
 * Version              : 1.0
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *    This program reads data from two sensors (temperature and humidity from DHT11, and light level from LDR), 
 *    retrieves the current time from an API, and sends this data to the rckh.xyz server using an ESP8266.
 * 
 * Inputs:
 *    - Temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor
 *    - Light level from the HW-486 LDR
 *    - Time from the timeapi.io API (or system time if the API is unavailable)
 *    - A push button to trigger data transmission
 * 
 * Outputs:
 *    - Data (node, temperature, humidity, light level, timestamp) is sent to the rckh.xyz server
 * 
 * Example Application:
 *    This program can be used to record temperature, humidity, light levels and upload the data
 *    to a server when the button is pressed.
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 *    - External libraries: ESP8266WiFi.h, HTTPClient.h, DHT.h
 *    - Hardware: ESP8266, DHT11, HW-486 LDR, pushbutton
 * 
 * Usage Notes:
 *    - Change the Wi-Fi credentials in the code according to the network used.
 *    - The program will only send data when the pushbutton is pressed.
